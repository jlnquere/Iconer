# Iconer 
AppIconSet made simple. 

Iconer is a stupidly simple mac application to generate `AppIcon.appiconset` bundles: you drag and drop your assets, and it will generate it. No more missing icon resolution, no more duplicate, no more warning. 

# About
This application is my first mac app. It's just a port of a Ruby script that I use everytime. I made it for myself first. But if you have any idea / request: feel free to use Github issues :)
